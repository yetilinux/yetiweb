<b>Mar 18 - pacman 1.2 released</b>
</p><ul class="plain"><li>I've put a pacman-1.2 package up on the ftp site.  This version
  comes with the pacsync utility, which lets you automatically download and install
	packages and otherwise keep your system up to date.</li></ul>
<b>Mar 13 - rsync server in place</b>
<ul class="plain"><li>I've set up an rsync server on archlinux.org. This will let
	everybody keep their /usr/abs tree up to date, and it will also let you easily
	mirror the ftp site.  I'm in need of download mirrors, so please, if anybody would
	like to volunteer, email me and I'll put you on the mirror page.<br><br>
	If you don't already have it, create the directory /usr/abs. Then to
	update your /usr/abs tree, you can do the following:<br>
	<blockquote><pre># cd /usr/abs &amp;&amp; rsync -av archlinux.org::abs .</pre></blockquote>
	</li></ul>
<b>Mar 11 - Arch Linux 0.1 (Homer) released</b>
<ul class="plain"><li>I've finally got a bootable iso image on the ftp site.
	The bad news is that you don't get a pretty interactive installer.  But if
	you wanted one of those, you would have gone with RedHat, right? &nbsp; ;)<br><br>
	Here's a short list of some future plans for 0.2:<ul class="list">
	  <li>Document ABS (Arch Build System) and provide a cvs-like update method so people
		    can start building their own packages.
		</li><li>Finish the contrib area and start posting third-party packages.
		</li><li>Finish pacman 1.2 -- this will allow you to update your entire system with
		    the latest stable version of all packages, all with one command.
		</li><li>Add a pretty interactive installer.  ;)
		</li><li>Add more documentation -- our docs really suck right now.  Please!  If you have
		    questions, just <a href="mailto:jvinet@zeroflux.org">ask</a>!  Also, if you
				want to help out in any way, please <a href="mailto:jvinet@zeroflux.org">let me know</a>.
				I'm a student so my free time comes and goes at the will of my evil profs.
	</li></ul><br>
	I'll try to get the docs up for ABS (Arch Build System) which, IMHO, is one
	of the best advantages of Arch.  With ABS, you can easily create new packages,
	and it's trivial to rebuild existing packages with your own customizations.<br><br>
	And on that note, if you start to use the ABS and build your own packages, I welcome
	your submissions.  My "development team" is working on a contrib area as we speak.  ;)
	</li></ul>

<p><span class="subheader">About</span><br><br>
<span class="text">Arch Linux is an i686-optimized linux distribution based on ideas from
  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020328043401/http://www.crux.nu/">CRUX</a>, a great distribution developed by Per Lidén. It is lightweight and
	contains the latest stable versions of software.  Packages are in .tar.gz format and are tracked
	by a package manager that is designed to allow easy package upgrades.  Arch is quite streamlined
	compared to some other distributions.  Things that are relatively unused (by me, anyway) are not
	kept (info-pages, for example).  A default Arch install leaves you with a solid base; from there,
	you can add packages to create the custom installation you're looking for.  Arch has a package
	build system that allows you to easily create your own packages, which makes it very easy to
	rebuild a package with your own custom configuration.  Arch also aims to use the newer features
	available to linux users, such as reiserfs/ext3 and devfs.
